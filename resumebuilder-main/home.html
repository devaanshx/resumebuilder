            <h3>Why should I use a resume builder?</h3>
            <p> Using a resume builder makes the process of creating a resume significantly <br> faster and easier. Ever tried building your resume with Word?</p>
            <p> The whole process is a huge pain - you make a TINY change to your resume, <br> and the entire resume layout gets completely messed up.</p>
            <p> With a resume builder, you don't have to worry about the nitty gritty of resume <br> creation, like font selection, layout, formatting, etc.</p>
            <p> All you have to do is pick a resume template, fill it in, and then you're ready to <br> start applying for jobs!</p>

                    any of our premium features.
                </li>

            <h3>What is a resume?</h3>
            <p> A resume (also known as a CV, or curriculum vitae) is a 1-2 page document that <br> summarizes your work experience and career history.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Your work history

            <h3>What's the difference between a CV and a resume?</h3>

            <p> In the United States, however, a resume is a document you use to apply for jobs, <br>while a CV is mainly used by academics.</p>
